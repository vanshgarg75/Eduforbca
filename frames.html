        <pre>
1. Frames open up navigational possibilities, and they can be used to unity information from several sites onto one page.
2. Frames have one portion of the window always visible while others scroll through longer content.
3. Frames can divide the browser window horizontally as well as vertically.
4. You can display tables, links, forms, images through frames.
5. You can use frames as showing index links in one sub-region and their corresponding pages in the other sub-region. By this, index will never go 
    out of sight while browsing the document.
A frameset divides the window into rows and columns like tables. The simplest of framesets might just divide the screen into two rows, whereas a 
complex frameset could use several rows and columns. There is also a special kind of frame called an frame which is a single window that can sit 
anywhere inside a page.

HOW FRAMES WORK <br>
When you view a page with frames in a browser, you are actually looking at several HTML documents at once. Actually a web page with frames is 
a frameset document, which is an HTML document and in which each frame is drawn in such a way that a HTML document is displayed in each 
frame. When the browser sees that this is a frameset document, it draws out the frames as instructed in the document and then pulls the separate 
HTML documents.
There are three tags for the implementation of frames in the HTML document. Let's have a brief introduction to them. However, we will discuss 
them in detail in next sections.
1. ‹frameset>: The &lt; frameset > element is used instead of the &lt; body > element, as this defines the rows and columns your page is divided into.
 However, the frameset document uses the &lt;head> element. This sets framesets apart from all other web pages. ‹frameset> tag have the attributes 
 like rows and cols to divide the window into rows and columns respectively.
 2. ‹frame>: Each frame is then represented by a &lt;frame › element. ‹frame> tag is contained within the &lt;frameset> element. The primary job of 
 the &lt;frame>element is to specify which HTML document to display; however, you can control other features of a frame.
 3. «noframes»: The «noframes> element provides a message for users whose browsers do not support frames. Minimal content is there within 
 the ‹noframes> element. It is similar to the alternative text provided in image elements.
 To get a better idea of how frames work, here is the code for the frameset.
