→used to display images on a web page.
    &lt;img/> tag attributes:
->src: give the name and the location of the image with the file extension.

Note: we can also give the url (image link) from the web.
Format: “image_folder/image_name.extension”
->width: width of the image in pixels
->height: height of image in pixels
->alt: alternate text. this is the text that will be displayed when the image is not shown.

top bottom middle left right
->hspace: space in px to be inserted on the left and the right side of the image

→Steps to work with images in HTML:
Step 1: Create a folder for storing images inside the website folder.
Generally, we call this folder: images
Step 2: Copy the images inside the images folder.
Step 3: render the image on the webpage using the &lt;img /> tag
→Note:
→every image has an aspect ratio. width:height
→If you want to maintain the aspect ratio and don't want to stretch the image then give
only one attribute out of width and height.
