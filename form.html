Forms are one of the important elements of HTML. When you want to gather some information from a visitor to your site, you have to use an 
HTML form. The complexity of torm depends on the purpose for which it is created. Some forms are quite complex such as the form you fill for 
booking airline tickets or to apply online for some scholarship etc. Others can be simple such as a search box is a simple form for finding some text 
on the webpage.
The forms you fill online resemble the paper forms you fill for various purposes. These forms contain the spaces to enter text, boxes for selecting 
an appropriate option etc. You can create a form using HTML  &lt;FORM> tag. It consist of various elements known as form controls like textboxes,
 textarea, checkboxes, radio buttons, drop down menu etc. to collect various type of information from visitors.
Some common examples of forms are:
Reservation forms
Online order and payment forms
• Registration and Contact forms
• Surveys and market research forms
Feedback forms
• Scholarship forms
Email Sign Up and Sign In forms
• Employment application forms
To define a form &lt;FORM> tag is used. It is a paired tag where the opening &lt;FORM> tag indicates the start of the form and the closing &lt;/FORM> 
tag represents the end of the form.
All the form elements are enclosed between these two tags. You can also use HTML tags inside the &lt;FORM> tag such as &lt;H1> for headings, 
&lt;UL> for defining unordered lists etc.

ATTRIBUTES OF FORM ELEMENTS

The &lt;form> tag consists of two mandatory attributes and some optional attributes. The two compulsory attributes of ‹form> tag are Action and
 Method.
• ACTION: This attribute specifies the URL of the web page that will open when the visitor clicks on the submit button. The address can be either
 a script name that will process the form or an email address that is specified using "mailto." keyword.
For example -
‹form action = "register.asp">
‹form action=mailto:inderpreet.kaur@gmail.com>
In the first example, when the user clicks the submit button, the form's values are redirected to the page register.asp that will process these values 
whereas in the second example, these values are mailed to the specified email id.
• METHOD: This attribute is used to specify how the data will be sent from client to web server when submit button is clicked. There are two
 ways to submit the data :
• GET Method: It is the default method for sending data back to the web server.
When this method is used, the information that you submit in the form will be attached to the end of the URL of the page specified in the action 
method. It captures the data from various fields of the form, encodes this information to a URL which points to a web page. It is used when you 
have little data to send back to the server as the maximum amount of data that can be sent is 2048 bytes.
POST Method: It is used when there is large amount of data that is to be sent back to the server. It captures the data from the various fields 
of form and sends it as a separate bit stream of data through the HTTP header. Thus the data is not seen in the URL.
